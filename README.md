# Algorithm Design Prep

Welcome to my personal playground for problem-solving with various algorithmic techniques! This repository is packed with a diverse set of algorithmic paradigms to help one master the art. Here are the four main categories covered:

* **Greedy Algorithms**: they make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are often used for optimization problems.

* **Divide & Conquer Algorithms**: it is a powerful technique that involves recursively breaking down a problem into subproblems, solving them, and then combining their solutions.

* **Dynamic Programming**: it involves breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. The solutions to subproblems are stored and reused as needed.

* **Network Flow**: they are used to find the optimal flow in a flow network. They are crucial for solving problems related to transportation, communication, and more.

In addition to these, we also cover various **Graph Algorithms** which are fundamental for analyzing and processing data represented as graphs.
